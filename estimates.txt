RTO and RPO for a Multi-AZ, Multi-Region RDS Database

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

The RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for a single AZ outage would be around 60-120 seconds 
This is because AWS would automatically failover from the database in the Inactive AZ to the database in the Active AZ.
This failover happens quickly due to the synchronous data replication that's carried out across the databases in the different Availability Zones.


2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage

The RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for a single region outage could be around 60-90 minutes.
In this scenario, there is no automatic failover but since there is an active Read Replica in a standby region, we first have to promote the read replica to a primary instance so it can handle both read and write traffic (as opposed to read traffic alone while it's a read replica)
After this, applications connected to the database in the inactive region would need to be manually switched to the newly promoted instance in the standby region. 
We also need to note that the replication happening between regions is asynchronous.


3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

The RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is the maximum duration that we will lose data during the switch between the two Availability Zones
The data loss will occur only during the failover period, since data is copied synchronously we expect a similar time to the RTO which is 60 - 120 seconds


4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage

The RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is the maximum duration that we will lose data during the switch between the two Reginos
Connected applications would lose all data during this period, until the manual failover to the instance in the standby region is complete. We can also expect a time frame of around 60 - 90 minutes.
